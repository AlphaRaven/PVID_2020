## Getting started
Give basic instructions on how to run your current project and/or how to load dataset specified in previous step.

### Prerequisities
| Library | Version |
| ------ | ------ |
| [OpenCV]  | 4.0.0 |
| [OpenGL] | 4.1.5 |
### Installing
If there are any necessary scripts needed for your project to run (e.g. `data preprocessing`, `model loading`, ...) Please update you instructions to the current chapter
```
python this_script.py --data=<path>
```

To run the application run the following program:
```
python this_main.py --data=<path> --switch_a=<test>
```

## Solution and algorithms
In this chapter try to describe algorithms along with all the pipelines you have used in your project to get to your goals. Each path should be structured and easy to read and understand. If it is possible, give preliminary results and visualisations for each path given to support your discoveries.

### List of algorithms
* `erode()`
  * used to overcome the issue of ... along with ... 
  * used with explicit parameters of ....

### Pipeline 1
We used `<method>` after `<that>` to get to `<this>`. After `<those>` items were substracted from `<them>`, `<they>` were clearly visible for further processing with `<method>`, to get to `<these>` visualisations:

## Results
In this chapter present your results of your project. If there is any qualitative or quantitative evaluation (e.g. benchmarks or visual results), add them to this chapter.

| Model | Accuracy |
| ------ | ------ |
| [BEST]  | 78.5% |
| [OURS] | 81.2% |
| [BETTER] | 101.1% |
